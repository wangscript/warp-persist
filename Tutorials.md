# Examples #

Checkout the [source](http://code.google.com/p/warp-persist/source/checkout) code, which has an example webapp called codemonkey. The 80 odd tests can also be useful to look through.

Read the javadoc (see 1.0 tag **/doc**). And the documentation on http://www.wideplay.com.

# Blogs on warp-persist #

These are some blogs/tutorials from around the web (not official):
  * Dekoh developer blog on [warp-persist with JPA/TopLink](http://blogs.dekoh.com/dev/2007/10/15/easing-jpa-application-developement-by-using-google-guice/) (pretty detailed)
  * Tutorial on [warp-persist and db4o](http://developer.db4o.com/blogs/community/archive/2008/03/03/use-db4o-in-you-guice-applications-through-warp.aspx)
  * Somewhat outdated (for warp-mvc) but detailed blog on [warp-mvc and warp-persist with Hibernate](http://www.jroller.com/dhanji/entry/a_blog_application_continued_persistence) (still accurate for warp-persist)
  * Peter Mularien's blog on [Wicket and warp-persist](http://www.mularien.com/blog/2007/11/28/bleeding-edge-transactional-wicket-web-applications-with-warp-and-guice/) (this blog is pre-1.0 release, comments on warp-persist's "bleeding-edge" nature are somewhat dated)
