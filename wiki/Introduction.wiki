#summary What is warp-persist?

== Introduction ==

Most serious applications need to interact with a data store. This may be as simple as a desktop chat program that stores user preferences, or as complex as an enterprise web application dealing with several thousands of transactions to a relational database.

Warp-persist is a lightweight library that provides the bridge between your application code and the frameworks (Hibernate, JPA, etc.) that provide data persistence. It does for persistence, what [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice Google Guice] does for your objects and services.

Mostly, it makes working with the data layer easy. And safe.
